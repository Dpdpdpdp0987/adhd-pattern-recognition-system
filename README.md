# ADHD Pattern Recognition System

## Overview

The ADHD Pattern Recognition System is an intelligent health monitoring solution that integrates with Android Health Connect to track, analyze, and provide insights into behavioral patterns related to ADHD. This system helps users understand their daily patterns, identify triggers, and optimize their routines for better focus and productivity.

## Features

- **Health Connect Integration**: Seamless connection to Android Health Connect for accessing health and activity data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced algorithms to identify patterns in behavior, sleep, activity, and focus
- **Memory Integration**: Context-aware memory system for tracking historical patterns and trends
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking and analysis of relevant health metrics
- **Personalized Insights**: Custom recommendations based on individual patterns and behaviors

## Technology Stack

- **Android Health Connect SDK**: For health data access
- **Python/Kotlin**: Primary development languages
- **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition and predictive analytics
- **SQLite/Room**: Local data storage
- **TensorFlow Lite**: On-device ML inference

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later)
- Android SDK (API level 28 or higher)
- Health Connect app installed on test device
- Python 3.8+ (for ML model development)
- Kotlin 1.5+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dpdpdpdp0987/adhd-pattern-recognition-system.git
   cd adhd-pattern-recognition-system
   ```

2. **Set up Health Connect permissions**
   - Add required permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Request user consent for health data access
   - Configure Health Connect data types

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For Android components
   ./gradlew build
   
   # For Python ML components
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the application**
   - Copy `config.example.properties` to `config.properties`
   - Set up your API keys and configuration parameters
   - Configure Health Connect data permissions

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize Health Connect Wrapper**
   ```kotlin
   val healthConnectClient = HealthConnectClient.getOrCreate(context)
   // Configure data types and permissions
   ```

2. **Set up Pattern Recognition**
   ```python
   from pattern_recognition import PatternAnalyzer
   analyzer = PatternAnalyzer()
   analyzer.load_model()
   ```

3. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   # Start the monitoring service
   ./start_monitoring.sh
   ```

## Module Documentation

### Health Connect Wrapper
Handles all interactions with Android Health Connect API, including:
- Data retrieval and synchronization
- Permission management
- Data type mapping
- Error handling and retries

### Memory Integration
Manages historical data and context:
- Long-term pattern storage
- Context-aware data retrieval
- Data aggregation and summarization

## Data Privacy

This system prioritizes user privacy:
- All data processing happens locally on-device
- No data is transmitted to external servers without explicit consent
- Users maintain full control over their health data
- Health Connect permissions are managed through Android's secure framework
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
